# Moni's Multiblocks
This mods adds in the Hypogean Infuser (and related bus) for the Monifactory
modpack. In the future we might add in other multiblocks and stuff if needed,
but currently its just the one.

This repo is intended for devs, so the resources in here are mainly for
explaining how and why things work and not how to use them in-game. Of course
that's still useful to the technically inclined.

# Lore
Since these multiblocks are made up and don't follow the normal laws of physics,
we need to make up our own rules for them to follow. That way they'll make sense
within the game, and in future additions or changes. For example the Hypogean
Infuser works via infusing items with sculk, it wouldn't make sense for a
parallel version of it to not have that sculk incorporated somehow.

`lore.org` contains the relevant lore explaining how these machines are supposed
to be working, as well as, general lore about the world (like how sculk really
loves the cold)

`mechanics.org` contains information on how machines are supposed to work
mechanically. Helps to define what exactly is intended behavoir and what's a
bug (also lets people easily see how its supposed to work).
